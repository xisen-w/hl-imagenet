# HL-ImageNet: A Preliminary Heuristic-Learning Demo for Image Classification

> This is not a standard ImageNet benchmark result. Phase 1 used a mixed exploratory setup with 4 real Tiny ImageNet classes and 6 synthetic classes, and the main 86.1% number is development-set accuracy after iterative tuning. Phase 2 now includes split-aware validation diagnostics, benchmark comparisons against transparent non-neural baselines, sample-level attribution traces, and attribution-guided candidate selection. Current Phase 2 validation shows the HL symbolic classifier above random and majority baselines, below simple handcrafted feature baselines, and highly structured around false-positive attractors, victim classes, and globally overactive features.

**Heuristic Learning for Image Classification — Without Neural Networks**

A coding agent (Claude) iteratively built a purely symbolic image classifier through 248 evaluation iterations across 11 sessions. No neural networks, no gradient descent, no backpropagation. The system uses classical computer vision (OpenCV), hand-crafted features, and symbolic scoring rules.

This is an application of Jiayi Weng's [Heuristic Learning](https://trinkle23897.github.io/learning-beyond-gradients/) framework to static image classification.

## Results

### Phase 1 (completed): Development-set accuracy

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Dev-set top-1 (4 hard classes) | **84%** (168/200) |
| Dev-set top-1 (all 10 incl. synthetic) | **86.1%** (198/230) |
| Validation folder (4 hard classes) | **54%** (216/400) |
| Non-overlapping validation subset | **51.4%** (186/362) |
| Hard classes | golden retriever, mushroom, teapot, school bus |
| Resolution | 64x64 (Tiny ImageNet) |
| Inference time | ~25ms per image (M-series Mac) |

> **Important**: The 86.1% was measured on the same 230 images used during development. All ~50 thresholds were tuned against these images. A later 400-image validation folder scored 54%, but exact file-hash checking found 38 images overlapping with the development set. On the stricter non-overlapping subset, accuracy is 51.4% (186/362). See [Evaluation Methodology](#evaluation-methodology) for full details.


### Phase 2.3: Split-aware validation benchmark with non-neural baselines

Phase 2.3 adds a benchmark harness that compares the current HL symbolic classifier against transparent non-neural baselines on the same 10-class Phase 2 validation split.

Benchmark artifacts:

- `logs/phase2/benchmarks/latest_phase2_benchmark.md`
- `logs/phase2/benchmarks/latest_phase2_benchmark.json`

Current full validation benchmark:

| Model | Top-1 | Top-3 | Mean latency ms |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| handcrafted_stats_knn | 46.1% | 72.1% | 0.88 |
| image_stats_centroid | 43.4% | 73.1% | 0.68 |
| color_centroid | 36.7% | 65.9% | 0.17 |
| hl_symbolic_classifier | 33.4% | 68.6% | 73.39 |
| majority_class | 10.0% | 30.0% | 0.00 |
| random | 9.9% | 32.4% | 0.05 |

> **Benchmark boundary**: This is a validation-split comparison, not a final held-out ImageNet result. The benchmark harness does not change classifier behavior and does not claim accuracy improvement. The current HL symbolic classifier beats random and majority baselines, but does not yet beat simple handcrafted non-neural baselines on this split.

Run the benchmark harness:

    python scripts/run_phase2_benchmarks.py --data-root ".\data\phase2" --split val

The local Tiny ImageNet image split is intentionally not committed. The benchmark harness and generated benchmark artifacts are committed; `data/` remains ignored.


### Phase 2.4: Sample-level attribution layer

Phase 2.4 adds a sample-level attribution layer that turns every Phase 2 validation prediction into an auditable row with true label, predicted label, top-3 labels, score margin, outcome class, collapse path, activated feature summary, proof trace, and optional baseline agreement.

Attribution artifacts:

- `logs/phase2/attribution/latest_phase2_attribution.md`
- `logs/phase2/attribution/latest_phase2_attribution.json`
- `logs/phase2/attribution/latest_phase2_attribution.csv`

Current full validation attribution summary:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Validation samples | 2,000 |
| Correct | 668 |
| Top-3 rescue | 705 |
| Miss | 627 |
| Top-1 accuracy | 33.4% |
| Top-3 accuracy | 68.6% |
| Baseline-right / HL-wrong samples | 817 |
| HL-right / all-baselines-wrong samples | 68 |

Top collapse paths:

| Collapse path | Count |
|---|---:|
| sports_car → king_penguin | 113 |
| orange → banana | 83 |
| golden_retriever → banana | 82 |
| teapot → king_penguin | 72 |
| brown_bear → banana | 70 |
| mushroom → banana | 67 |

> **Attribution boundary**: This layer does not change classifier behavior and does not claim accuracy improvement. It exists to inspect individual failures before any future Phase 2.5 scoring or signature changes. Proof traces explain model behavior; they do not prove correctness.

Run the attribution layer:

    python scripts/run_phase2_attribution.py --data-root ".\data\phase2" --split val


### Phase 2.5: Attribution-guided candidate selection

Phase 2.5 adds a candidate-selection layer that reads the Phase 2 diagnostic, benchmark, and attribution artifacts, then emits a ranked plan for future controlled classifier changes. It does not change classifier behavior.

Candidate artifacts:

- `logs/phase2/candidates/latest_phase2_candidate_plan.md`
- `logs/phase2/candidates/latest_phase2_candidate_plan.json`

Current candidate-selection summary:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Validation samples | 2,000 |
| Top-1 accuracy | 33.4% |
| Top-3 accuracy | 68.6% |
| Baseline-right / HL-wrong samples | 817 |
| HL-right / all-baselines-wrong samples | 68 |
| Correct | 668 |
| Top-3 rescue | 705 |
| Miss | 627 |

Benchmark interpretation:

- HL is above `majority_class` and `random`.
- HL is below or equal to `handcrafted_stats_knn`, `image_stats_centroid`, and `color_centroid`.
- Candidate changes should aim to close gaps against handcrafted baselines while protecting the 68 HL-unique wins.

Top candidate findings:

| Surface | Finding |
|---|---|
| Main over-attractors | `banana`, `king_penguin`, `golden_retriever` |
| Main victim classes | `teapot`, `brown_bear`, `sports_car`, `orange`, `mushroom` |
| Main warning | Several Phase 2 signatures activate on too many samples |
| Recommended next move | Inspect baseline-right / HL-wrong rows against HL-right / all-baselines-wrong rows before modifying classifier behavior |
| Likely first code target | Tighten globally overactive Phase 2 signatures or add regression guards before attractor suppression |

> **Candidate-selection boundary**: This layer ranks possible future interventions. It does not change classifier behavior, prove correctness, or claim accuracy improvement. Any future classifier change must rerun diagnostics, benchmarks, attribution, and candidate selection.

Run candidate selection:

    python scripts/run_phase2_candidates.py


### Phase 2.6A: Regression guard baseline

Phase 2.6A adds a regression guard layer that locks the current Phase 2 evidence state before any classifier behavior change. It reads the benchmark, attribution, and candidate-selection artifacts, then emits guard thresholds for future controlled classifier deltas.

Regression guard artifacts:

- `logs/phase2/regression_guard/latest_phase2_regression_guard.md`
- `logs/phase2/regression_guard/latest_phase2_regression_guard.json`

Current regression baseline:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| HL top-1 accuracy | 33.4% |
| HL top-3 accuracy | 68.6% |
| Correct | 668 |
| Top-3 rescue | 705 |
| Miss | 627 |
| Baseline-right / HL-wrong | 817 |
| HL-right / all-baselines-wrong | 68 |

Guard contract:

| Guard | Threshold |
|---|---:|
| Minimum top-1 accuracy | 32.9% |
| Minimum top-3 accuracy | 68.1% |
| Minimum HL-unique wins | 61 |
| Maximum major-attractor increase | 0 |
| Required major-attractor decrease | 1 |
| Required victim-class improvement | 1 |

Major attractor false positives:

| Attractor | False positives |
|---|---:|
| banana | 416 |
| king_penguin | 389 |
| golden_retriever | 245 |

> **Regression-guard boundary**: This layer does not change classifier behavior and does not claim accuracy improvement. It locks the pre-change evidence baseline so future classifier deltas can be accepted or rejected under explicit guardrails.

Run the regression guard:

    python scripts/run_phase2_regression_guard.py

### Per-class accuracy (dev set)

| Class | Dev Accuracy | Notes |
|-------|:---:|-------|
| mushroom | 88% (44/50) | Real Tiny ImageNet images |
| school bus | 84% (42/50) | Real Tiny ImageNet images |
| golden retriever | 82% (41/50) | Real Tiny ImageNet images |

| school bus | 62% (62/100) | -22pp |
| golden retriever | 56% (56/100) | -26pp |
| teapot | 53% (53/100) | -29pp |

---

## Evaluation Methodology

### How the 86.1% was computed

The 230-image evaluation set consists of:
- **4 hard classes**: 50 real Tiny ImageNet images each (images 0–49 from each class's 500 training images)
- **6 easy classes**: 5 AI-generated synthetic images each (e.g., the "banana" images are yellow ellipses on grey noise — essentially trivial)

All 248 iterations of the HL loop tuned thresholds against these same 230 images. This makes the 86.1% a **development-set accuracy**, not a generalization metric.

### Validation results

We evaluated the final classifier (no code changes) on a 400-image Tiny ImageNet validation folder for the 4 hard classes:

- **54% overall** (216/400) on the 4 hard classes
- Exact file-hash checking found **38/400 images overlapping** with the development set
- On the stricter non-overlapping subset: **51.4%** (186/362)
- Clean 4-class random baseline: **25%**, so the validation result is about **2.1x random**
- Top-3 accuracy: 87.7%
- Largest drop: mushroom (88% → 45%), due to surgically tuned conjunction thresholds

### What's available in Tiny ImageNet

| Class | Total available | Used for dev | Used for val | Still unused |
|-------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| golden_retriever | 500 train + 50 val | 50 | 100 | 400 |
| mushroom | 500 train + 50 val | 50 | 100 | 400 |
| teapot | 500 train + 50 val | 50 | 100 | 400 |
| school_bus | 500 train + 50 val | 50 | 100 | 400 |
| banana | 500 train + 50 val | 0 (used synthetic) | 0 | 550 |

## Phase 2: Proper Train/Val Split (In Progress)

Phase 1 demonstrated that the HL loop *can* build a symbolic classifier, but the evaluation was on the tuning set. Phase 2 will use a proper split with all real images.

### 10 classes (all real Tiny ImageNet)

| # | Class | wnid | Confusable with |
|---|-------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | golden retriever | n02099601 | brown bear, mushroom, teapot |
| 2 | mushroom | n07734744 | golden retriever, teapot |
| 3 | teapot | n04398044 | golden retriever, mushroom |
| 4 | school bus | n04146614 | banana (both yellow) |
| 5 | banana | n07753592 | orange, school bus |
| 6 | orange | n07747607 | banana |
| 7 | brown bear | n02132136 | golden retriever |
| 8 | king penguin | n02056570 | — |
| 9 | jellyfish | n01910747 | — |
| 10 | sports car | n04285008 | — |

### Split (per class, 500 Tiny ImageNet train images available)

| Split | Images | Source | Purpose |
|-------|:---:|--------|---------|
| **Train** | 200 | images 0–199 | HL loop tuning + threshold selection |
| **Val** | 200 | images 200–399 | Reported during development |
| **Test** | 100 | images 400–499 | Looked at only once at the end |
| **External test** | 50 | official Tiny ImageNet val | Final external validation |

- **Total**: 2,000 train / 2,000 val / 1,000 test / 500 external = 5,500 images

### Rules

- The HL loop only looks at train-set errors for proposing fixes
- Val accuracy is the reported generalization metric
- Test set is touched only once at the very end
- No threshold tuning against val or test images

**Status**: Phase 2 exploratory classifier work has started upstream. The current repo includes Phase 2 class signatures, a flat 10-class hierarchy, soft scoring, Phase 2 evaluation logs, a Phase 2.2 diagnostic lens, a Phase 2.3 benchmark harness, a Phase 2.4 sample-level attribution layer, a Phase 2.5 attribution-guided candidate-selection layer, and a Phase 2.6A regression guard baseline.

Current diagnostic snapshot from logs/phase2/diagnostics/latest_phase2_diagnostic.md:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Source report | logs/phase2/eval_phase2_iter9_val_2026-05-12_14-37-05.json |
| Samples | 2,000 |
| Top-1 accuracy | 33.4% |
| Top-3 accuracy | 68.6% |
| Top-3 rescue gap | 35.2 percentage points |
| Major false-positive attractors | banana, king_penguin, golden_retriever |
| Major victim classes | teapot, brown_bear, sports_car |

> **Diagnostic boundary**: The Phase 2.2 diagnostic lens does not change classifier behavior and does not claim accuracy improvement. It turns existing Phase 2 evaluation logs into evidence artifacts showing attractor classes, victim classes, confusion gravity wells, and top-3 rescue gaps.

## How It Works

```
image (64x64 BGR)
  -> 5 classical vision sensors (edges, color, texture, segmentation, shape)
  -> ~30 symbolic atoms per image
  -> 40 registered features across 6 categories
  -> flat scorer (required/supporting/excluding formula)
  -> pairwise tiebreaker system (22 functions)
  -> prediction with full proof trace
```

### Scoring formula

Each class has required, supporting, and excluding feature lists:

```
score = required_avg * 0.6 + supporting_avg * 0.3 - excluding_avg * 0.2
```

If any required feature doesn't fire, the class scores zero.

### Tiebreaker system

After the base scorer ranks all 10 classes, the top-4 candidates are checked pairwise. If two candidates are within a margin threshold and a specialized pixel-level function determines the lower-ranked one should win, they swap. At most one swap per prediction.

### Explainability

Every prediction produces a human-readable proof trace:

```
Prediction: golden_retriever (0.751)
Alternatives: teapot (0.43), mushroom (0.40)

Evidence:
  golden_brown_color:   1.00 (golden/brown coverage: 0.58)
  golden_fur_in_nature: 1.00 (golden=0.58, green=0.06, var=2966)
  large_warm_blob:      1.00 (dominance=1.00, coverage=0.71)
  outdoor_animal_scene:  1.00 (nature=0.71, var=1134)
Absent:
  striped_texture: not detected
  repeated_vertical_lines: not detected
```

---

## The HL Loop

The system was built through the exact Heuristic Learning feedback loop:

```
run evaluation -> analyze confusion -> propose feature/fix -> test for regressions -> deploy or revert -> repeat
```

Each iteration tested a specific hypothesis. Fixes that caused net regression were reverted. The coding agent maintained experiment logs, reasoning snapshots, and proof traces throughout.

### Growth trajectory

```
Session 1:   ~20%   baseline sensors + features
Session 2:    35%   flat scorer (replaced broken hierarchy)
Session 3:    44%   compound features + tiebreakers
Session 4:    57%   tiebreaker expansion + school bus window pattern
Session 5:    62%   spatial attention + synthetic class tiebreakers
Session 6:    67%   eagle/banana solved to 100%
Session 7:    68%   plateau (DCT explored, failed)
Session 8:    78%   banana cap + compound conjunctions
Session 9:    80%   gradient/green conjunctions
Session 10:   85%   alt required features + guard tightening
Session 11:   86%   green+warm counter-signals (final)
```

### The ceiling

The remaining 32 errors (14%) come from the dog/mushroom/teapot triangle: at 64x64, all three are "warm-colored smooth blobs." The discriminative information (fur micro-texture, gill patterns, ceramic sheen) is below the 64x64 Nyquist frequency. This is **representation saturation**: no code edit can extract signal that isn't in the pixels.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Dependencies**: OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy (no ML frameworks)
- **Feature library**: 40 registered features, 22 pairwise tiebreakers
- **Lines of code**: ~5000 total, ~3900 non-blank
- **Development time**: ~20 hours across 11 sessions
- **Total eval runs**: 248
- **Estimated API cost**: ~$100-300 in LLM inference (exact figure TBD)
- **Coding agent**: Claude (Anthropic)

### Limitations and honesty notes

1. **Not a held-out accuracy**: The 86.1% is on the development set (same images used for tuning). The 400-image validation folder scored 54%, and the non-overlapping subset scored 51.4%. See [Evaluation Methodology](#evaluation-methodology).
2. **Synthetic easy classes**: 6 of 10 classes used trivial AI-generated images (5 each). These don't constitute a meaningful evaluation target. However, they did serve a design role: the system had to learn *not* to predict zebra on golden retriever images, *not* to predict piano on school bus images, etc. The excluding features and negative-class pressure that shaped the classifier's decision boundaries came from having these classes as scoring alternatives during development. The evaluation claim should be read as 4-class; the system architecture is genuinely 10-class.
3. **Learned components**: The system stores two histogram prototypes (`prototypes.npz`) and all ~50 thresholds were tuned against the dev set. "Zero learned parameters" would be misleading. But there is no neural network, no gradient descent, and no backpropagation.
4. **What Phase 1 demonstrated**: The HL loop works — confusion-driven iteration, feature invention, tiebreaker design, regression testing, and representation saturation are all real phenomena. The trajectory from 12.7% to 84% on the hard classes shows genuine iterative improvement. The analysis of plateau-breaking moments, coupling complexity, and the ceiling remains valid regardless of the eval methodology issues.
5. **Phase 2 benchmark boundary**: The Phase 2.3 benchmark harness compares the current HL symbolic classifier against transparent non-neural baselines on the same validation split. Current results show HL above random and majority baselines, but below simple handcrafted non-neural baselines. This is benchmark discipline, not an accuracy-improvement claim.
6. **Phase 2 attribution boundary**: The Phase 2.4 attribution layer explains individual validation predictions and collapse paths. It does not change classifier behavior, prove correctness, or improve accuracy by itself.
7. **Phase 2 candidate-selection boundary**: The Phase 2.5 candidate-selection layer ranks possible future interventions from diagnostics, benchmarks, and attribution. It does not change classifier behavior or claim accuracy improvement.
8. **Phase 2 regression-guard boundary**: The Phase 2.6A regression guard locks the current evidence baseline before classifier changes. It does not change classifier behavior, prove correctness, or claim improvement.

AI agents must update this section only when repository purpose, evaluation claims, command surface, package structure, or phase status changes.

## AI operating contract

Any AI agent reading or modifying this repository must follow this order:

1. Read the root README first.
2. Read the mini README in the target folder.
3. Inspect only relevant source, docs, logs, or scripts.
4. Preserve the distinction between development-set tuning and held-out validation.
5. Preserve the no-neural-network and no-gradient-descent claim boundary unless code behavior changes.
6. Treat logs and plots as evidence artifacts, not independent proof.
7. Patch the smallest necessary surface.
8. Run the relevant command before claiming behavior changed.
9. Update local README context if folder purpose, hooks, artifacts, or invariants change.

## RCC documentation contract

RCC means Repository Context Canon. In this repository, RCC is implemented as a documentation topology where the root README provides global context and subfolder READMEs expose local purpose, hooks, artifacts, theory or method basis, invariants, and examples.

RCC module fields:

- S = formal specification
- H = hooks and integration edges
- A = artifacts and code units
- T = theory or method basis
- I = invariants
- E = example

AI agents should reconstruct repository context through bounded README surfaces first, then inspect relevant files.

## AI file routing guide

- hlinet/sensors: raw pixel-to-atom extraction.
- hlinet/scene: scene graph construction and spatial relations.
- hlinet/features: symbolic feature predicates.

## AI non-claim lock

Never claim or imply:

- Phase 1 is a standard ImageNet benchmark.
- 86.1 percent is held-out accuracy.
- Development-set tuning proves generalization.
- Synthetic easy classes are equivalent to real Tiny ImageNet classes.
- Symbolic heuristics beat neural networks generally.
- There are no learned quantities when prototypes or tuned thresholds are being discussed.
- Plots or logs prove correctness without evaluation context.
- RCC documentation proves source correctness.
- Phase 2 diagnostics prove classifier correctness or imply classifier improvement.
- Phase 2 benchmarks prove final ImageNet performance or imply classifier improvement.
- Phase 2 attribution proves classifier correctness or implies classifier improvement.
- Phase 2 candidate selection proves classifier correctness or implies classifier improvement.
- Phase 2 regression guards prove classifier correctness or imply classifier improvement.

## AI interpretation of current evidence

HL-ImageNet is a preliminary heuristic-learning demo showing that a coding agent can iteratively maintain a symbolic image classifier using classical vision features, scoring rules, tiebreakers, logs, and proof traces. Phase 1 demonstrates confusion-driven improvement and representation-saturation behavior, but its headline accuracy is development-set accuracy, not a clean held-out benchmark. Phase 2 exploratory classifier work is now present upstream. The Phase 2.2 diagnostic lens exposes validation failure geometry from existing logs, the Phase 2.3 benchmark harness compares the current HL classifier against transparent non-neural baselines, and the Phase 2.4 attribution layer emits per-sample validation traces for inspecting collapse paths and feature activation, the Phase 2.5 candidate-selection layer ranks future intervention candidates before any classifier behavior changes, and the Phase 2.6A regression guard locks the pre-change evidence baseline before controlled deltas. The stricter validation numbers, diagnostic non-claim boundaries, and benchmark non-claim boundaries must remain visible whenever results are summarized.

## Required local verification

After documentation-only RCC changes, run:

    git diff -- README.md
    git status

After source changes, run the relevant local command from the repository root:

    pip install -e .
    python -m hlinet.eval.runner
    python scripts/predict_image.py path/to/image.jpg

If plots are changed, regenerate them through the plotting script rather than editing generated images directly:

    python scripts/generate_plots.py

## README maintenance rule

When adding a new major folder, create a mini README with Purpose, S, H, A, T, I, and E fields.

## Final AI warning

This repository is strongest when claim boundaries stay visible. Do not optimize documentation to sound stronger than the evidence. Preserve the development-set versus validation-set distinction, the synthetic-class caveat, the Phase 2 split labels, the diagnostic non-claim boundary, the benchmark non-claim boundary, the attribution non-claim boundary, the candidate-selection non-claim boundary, the regression-guard non-claim boundary, and the fact that RCC improves navigation rather than proving code correctness.
